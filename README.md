# Gleam Cheatsheets

## This is
- A Work-In-Progress
- A searchable listing of:
  - Common problems or tasks
  - The standard library features best suited to each task

## This is not
- An exhaustive Gleam reference document. It explains the *why* and *where* of using standard library functions, but does not detail each function's full behavior.
- A tutorial to follow. Though parts may feel like a tutorial, these sheets are designed to be referenced as needed.

## Target Audience
- You are comfortable with recursion.
- You've taken the Gleam tour already, especially:
  - [The Case Statement and Pattern Matching](https://tour.gleam.run/flow-control/case-expressions/)
  - [Functions, especially with tail-call recursion](https://tour.gleam.run/flow-control/tail-calls/)
- You have a good guess what these functions do:
  - `print`, `println`, `console.write`
  - `list.map`, `list.filter`
  - `int.modulo`, `int.to_base16`
